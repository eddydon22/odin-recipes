        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are very few things in life as beautiful as a 
            glistening, smoky flank steak 
            on a grill,            
             being painted with beerbecue sauce.
             Any beer will do, but try to use something on
              the more aggressive side if you can.
             The subtle bitterness from the beer in the 
             background really makes this sauce pop.</p>
