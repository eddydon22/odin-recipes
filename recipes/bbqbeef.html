        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are very few things in life as beautiful as a 
            glistening, smoky flank steak 
            on a grill,            
             being painted with beerbecue sauce.
             Any beer will do, but try to use something on
              the more aggressive side if you can.
             The subtle bitterness from the beer in the 
             background really makes this sauce pop.</p>

             <h2>Steps</h2>
             <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>pour ketchup, mollasses, and white vinegarin a bowl;
                add white sugar, 2 teaspoons black pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, cayenne 
                pepper, cumin, allspice, and cinnamon. Whisk until sauce is smooth. pour in beer</li>
                
                <li><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>Place flank steak into a non-reactive container; pour
                sauce over meat. Poke at least 100 holes per side in the flank steak using 2 forks.</li>
                
                <li><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>Cover container with plastic wrap and marinate
                beef 8 to 12 hours (up to over night)</li>

                <li><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>Remove flank steak from marinade and pat the meat 
                dry with paper towels. Pour leftover marinade into a saucepan, place over medium heat,
                 and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes to make a basting sauce.</li>
                 
                 <li><p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly 
                 oil the grate.Season flank steak with salt and black pepper.</li>
                 
                 <li><p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>Grill flank steak for 2 1/2 minutes; turn meat around on grate
                 to a 45-degree angle to make diamond grill marks; grill for 2 1/2 more minutes. Repeat on second
                 side, turning meat 45 degrees after 2 1/2 minutes and grilling 2 1/2 more minutes.</li>
                 
                 <li><p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>Flip steak to original side and paint meat with sauce.
                 Continue to grill until sauce has glazed onto the meat, about 30 seconds. Turn meat over and brush
                 other side with sauce. Sauce will burn if cooked too long. Repeat 1 more time, brushing and glazing
                 sauce onto meat for about 30 seconds on each side. An instant-read meat thermometer, inserted into
                 the thickest part of the flank steak, should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C).</li>

                 <li><p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>Transfer steak to a platter and let rest 5 to 10 minutes before
                 slicing lengthwise down the center; cut each half across the grain into slices about 3/8 inch thick.
                 Drizzle slices with more sauce to serve.</li>
