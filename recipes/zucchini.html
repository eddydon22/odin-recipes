             <h2>Ingredients</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
                <li>zucchini squash, cut into 'noodles' 
                    using a spiral slicer or vegetable peeler</li>
                <li>minced garlic</li>
                <li>sauce, or to taste</li>
                <li>Greek yogurt</li>
                <li>pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste</li>
                <li>and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Steps</h2>
             <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                
                <li><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over
                     medium-high heat. Working in batches, saute enough zucchini to fit in the
                     skillet with 1 teaspoon garlic until zucchini is slightly browned and softened,
                     3 to 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining olive oil, zucchini, and garlic. Transfer
                     cooked zucchini mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>Whisk marinara sauce, yogurt, Italian seasoning,
                     salt, and black pepper together in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until
                     sauce is warmed through, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour sauce over zucchini mixture in the
                     baking dish. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese and a pinch of Italian seasoning over the top.</li>
                <li><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
