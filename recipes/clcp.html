                and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and onion;
                cook until mushrooms are brown, 5 to 7 minutes.

                <li><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p></li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Cook
                in the same skillet over medium-high heat until browned and no longer pink, 7 to
                10 minutes. Add the mushrooms back to the skillet. Add cream cheese, lemon juice,
                and lemon zest; stir until cream cheese is melted. Remove from heat.
